## Summary

This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in collecting, working with, and cleaning a dataset, with the ultimate goal of preparing tidy data suitable for further analysis. In this project was produced:

    Tidy Data Set: A clean dataset that adheres to the principles of tidy data.
    GitHub Repository: A link to a GitHub repository containing the R script (run_analysis.R) used for performing the analysis.
    Code Book: A CodeBook.md file that describes the variables, the dataset, and any transformations or cleaning processes applied to the data.
    README.md: A README file in the repository explaining how the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones described in the CodeBook.md

## Tasks        

The specific tasks to be performed by the run_analysis.R script are outlined as follows:

    Merge Data: Combine the training and test sets to form a single dataset.
    Extract Features: Extract only the measurements related to the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Descriptive Activity Names: Use descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.
    Label Variables: Appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
    Create Tidy Data: From the labeled dataset, generate a second independent tidy dataset containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
